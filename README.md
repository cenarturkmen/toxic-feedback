## Toxic Feedback

This is an app where you can send feedback and see previous feedback built with React, tailwind, and TensorFlowJS.

For the TensorFlowJS part, you look at it the [original repo](!https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity)

For the backend(actually, there is no real backend) I use Nocode API. Basically, I keep the data on google sheets. If you wondering what is this you can check [coding with didem video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1h53Cuj8f0)
