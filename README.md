## Toxic Feedback


### What is Toxic Feedback?

This app allows you to send feedback and see previous feedback from users. also, you can see the feedback has a toxicity score. Toxicity scores are a number between 0 and 100. 0 is the least toxic and 100 is the most toxic. App has 7 categories of toxicity.
